## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What does the `=` (equals) operator do in JavaScript?
  The = symbol is used as the assignment operator in JavaScript. It assigns the value on its right to the variable on its left.

- What operator will return the data type of a variable value?
  The typeof operator will return the data type of a JavaScript variable.

- Which keyword is used to declare a variable in JavaScript?
  Using the var, let, or const keywords declares a variable and then you assign it a name. Best practice is that const should be used except when the value of the variable is expected to change. In that case, you would use let and in some situations we don't need to account for in this exercise, var.

- Which characters is a JavaScript variable allowed to begin with?
  Characters can include letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs, but must start with a letter, $, or \_.

- What are quotation marks used for in JavaScript?
  Strings are enclosed in quotation marks; you can use single quotes ('), double quotes ("), or backticks (`) to define a string.

- What is the purpose of strings in JavaScript?
  In JavaScript, a string is a sequence of characters used to represent text.

- What is the purpose of booleans in JavaScript?
  Booleans in JavaScript represent one of two values: true or false. They are typically used in conditional testing where you need to decide which path of code to execute based on the truthiness of a condition.

- What is the purpose of numbers in JavaScript?
  Numbers in JavaScript are used to represent both integer and floating-point values. JavaScript has a single number type and numbers can be written with or without decimals. Numbers can be used in JavaScript for mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

- What does `null` mean in JavaScript?
  The value null is intentionally used to represent "no value" or "empty value". It must be assigned explicitly to a variable. Null is used to intentionally denote the absence of any value.
